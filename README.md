# SpringBootMySQL
SpringBootMySQL is a practice project designed to help me learn how to develop RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and integrate them with a MySQL database. The project demonstrates how to set up database connectivity, define JPA entities, and use Spring Data JPA repositories to perform CRUD operations.
